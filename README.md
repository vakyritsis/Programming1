1. Introduction to Programming

2. Memory Model and Variable Concept

3. Basic Data Types and Operators

4. Control Structures

5. Functions, scope, lifetime of variables, function calls, parameter passing, and recursion.
Pointers

6. Arrays

## Getting Started
To get started with the course content, navigate to the respective folders for each topic. You'll find relevant code examples, exercises, and resources to deepen your understanding of each concept.

1. Homework 1 is an introduction project to C language. We have created a command line menu for the user and used stdio librady to communicate with him. 
2. Homework 2 was a about getting involved with string in C and use operation with string.h library.
3. In Homework 3 we had to use structs to create complicate data structures. The request was to create a program that creates the weekly schedule courses for one year of study in a university department. The program maintains a table for the courses and a table for the rooms and places the lecture of a course in one room based on specific criteria specified below. Some functionalities of the the programm are: 
   1. Insertion of a new course
   2. Print the lessons
   3. Scheduling a lecture of an existing course
   4. Print the program of the rooms
   5. Delete course
